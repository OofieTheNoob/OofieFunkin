# Oofie Engine
A Modified Version of Psych Engine 0.6.2 that tries to add new things.

## Installation
You must have Flixel 4.11.0, you can set it by doing this command in the command prompt `haxelib set flixel 4.11.0`, as this Engine contains scrolling BGs. (Sometimes.)
And the newer Haxe breaks some shit.
